## Problem Statement

Signoz has a facility to monitor docker. Unfortunately in https://github.com/rhildred/signoz it doesn't seem to work. Generate at least 2 ideas about what the issue is, looking on the internet and especially at the otel collector config, and the versions of software in the docker compose.

## Hypothesis

### 1 [`fix-otel-config`](https://github.com/nmrepos/INFO8985Task1/tree/fix-otel-config/)

- **Hypothesis 1:** The OpenTelemetry Collector is not collecting container metrics because the `docker_stats` receiver is missing.
- **Fix:**
  - Added `docker_stats` receiver in `otel-collector-config.yaml`
  - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e07e234-5c01-4259-92e8-ea0ec9417bfb)
  - Modified `metrics` pipeline to include the receiver
  - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8851815d-b4a1-4031-924a-5b23a79c021d)
- **Result:** Metrics still did not show up â€” socket access missing.
- **Conclusion:** This receiver is necessary but **not sufficient alone**.

### 2 [`fix-docker-socket`](https://github.com/nmrepos/INFO8985Task1/tree/fix-docker-socket)

- **Hypothesis 2:** The OpenTelemetry Collector cannot read from the Docker API because the `/var/run/docker.sock` file is not mounted inside the container.
- **Fix:**
  - Edited docker compose files (core, minimal, testing)
  - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb4034b7-9b65-4376-8f8a-a4104d4baea3)
  - Mounted Docker socket to `otel-collector`:
    ```yaml
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    ```
- **Result:** Docker metrics appeared successfully in the SigNoz dashboard.
- **Conclusion:** This fix resolved the issue â€” the collector now has access to container stats.
